Original / Romaji Lyrics	English Translation
Yatto me wo samashita kai  sore na no ni naze me mo awase ya shinai'n dai? 
"Osoi yo" to okoru kimi  koredemo yareru dake tobashite kitanda yo

Did you finally wake up? Then why don't you meet eyes with me? 
You scold me "You're late" but even so I rushed here as fast as I could

Kokoro ga karada wo oikoshite kitanda yo

My heart rushed here faster than my body could

Kimi no kami ya hitomi dake de mune ga itai yo 
Onaji toki wo suikonde hanashitakunai yo 
Haruka mukashi kara shiru  sono koe ni 
Umarete hajimete  nani wo ieba ii?

Just thinking about your hair and eyes hurts my heart 
I want to breathe in the same time and not let it go 
To the voice I knew since long ago 
What should I say for the first time in my life?

Kimi no zen zen zense kara boku wa  kimi wo sagashi hajimeta yo 
Sono bukiccho na waraikata wo megakete  yatte kitanda yo

I've been searching for you since your past-past-past life 
I came in pursuit of that clumsy way of laugh

Kimi ga zenzen zenbu naku natte  chirijiri ni nattatte 
Mou mayowanai  mata ichi kara sagashi hajimeru sa 
Mushiro zero kara  mata uchuu wo hajimete miyou ka

Even when you completely disappear and all of you is torn into pieces 
I won't be lost anymore, and I'll start searching you from the beginning again 
Or rather we can start a world from zero

Dokkara hanasu kana  kimi ga nemutteita aida no SUTOORII 
Nan'oku  nankounenbun no monogatari wo katari ni kitanda yo  kedo iza sono sugata kono me ni utsusu to

Where do I start- the story during the time you were asleep 
I came to tell you the stories worth millions of light years, but when I actually let my eyes reflect you

Kimi mo shiranu kimi to jarete  tawamuretai yo 
Kimi no kienu itami made aishite mitai yo 
Ginga nankobun ka no  hate ni deaeta 
Sono te wo kowasazu ni  dou nigitta nara ii?

I feel the want to play about with you, who you don't even know yourself 
I want to try loving your pain that doesn't disappear 
I've met your hand at the far edge of a few galaxies 
How do I hold it without breaking it?

Kimi no zen zen zense kara boku wa  kimi wo sagashi hajimeta yo 
Sono sawagashii koe to namida wo megake  yatte kitanda yo

I've been searching for you since your past-past-past life 
I came in pursuit of that loud voice and tears

Sonna kakumei zenya no bokura wo dare ga tomeru to iu'n darou 
Mou mayowanai  kimi no HAATO ni hata wo tateru yo 
Kimi wa boku kara akiramekata wo  ubaitotta no

Who would come stop us at the night before this revolution? 
I won't be lost anymore, and I'll put a flag on your heart 
You snatched away from me the way to give up

Zen zen zense kara boku wa  kimi wo sagashi hajimeta yo 
Sono bukiccho na waraikata wo megakete  yatte kitanda yo

I've been searching for you since our past-past-past life 
I came in pursuit of that clumsy way of laugh

Kimi ga zenzen zenbu naku natte  chirijiri ni nattatte 
Mou mayowanai  mata ichi kara sagashi hajimeru sa 
Nankounen demo  kono uta wo kuchizusami nagara
